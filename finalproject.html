            <h1>Biography</h1> <!-- Title of main section -->
                <p id="BioParagraph1">Marina Raskova was born to a middle-class Russian family. She initially wanted to become a musician, but eventually abandoned the idea to study chemistry. While working in a dye factory as a chemist, she met Sergei Raskov, an engineer, who she later married and had a daughter with. She changed careers in 1931 when she joined the Aerodynamic Navigation Lab of the Soviet Air Force as a draftswoman. At age 19, in 1933, she became the first female navigator in the Air Force. The following year Raskova became the first woman to teach at the Zhukovskii Air Academy.</p> <!-- First Paragraph -->
                <p id="BioParagraph2">In 1935, she divorced from her husband and focused on her flying career. She become a famous pilot as well as a navigator, setting a number of long distance records. With the outbreak of World War 2, the Soviet Union was in need of pilots and many women volunteered. Their applications were generally denired, even though thee were no rules about women being in the militry. Raskova appealed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" target="_Blank">Joseph Stalin</a> to let women fly in the war, and he responded by creating three all female air regiments. These included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Witches" target="_Blank">"The Night Witches"</a>, one of the most famous female air regiments during the war.</p> <!-- Second Paragraph -->
                <p id="BioParagraph3">Raskova personally took command of the 125th Bomber Regiment, for which she obtained the very best equipment available. The 125th regiment went on to fly 134 missions over the course of the war, dropping over 980 tons of bombs. She was killed on January 4th 1943 while attempting to lead two other planes to a safe airfield. She was forced into landing on the Volga Bank, which resulted in the deaths of the entire bomber crew.</p> <!-- Third Paragraph -->

                <p id="LPar1">Her ashes were buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, beside Polina Osipenko's, on Red Square. She was posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War I Class. An American ship, Ironclad, (launched as Mystic in April 1919) that had taken part in Convoy PQ 17 was transferred to Russian ownership and renamed the SS Marina Raskova in June 1943.</p>
                <p id="LPar2">A street was named after her in Moscow and Kazan respectively, as well as a square in Moscow, some schools and Young Pioneer detachments. There was a bust of her at the "M.M. Raskova" Higher Military Aviation School of Pilots in Tambov, but that school ceased to function in 1997.</p>
